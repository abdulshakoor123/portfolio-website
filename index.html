    <h2>Introduce yourself with a brief bio.</h2>
    <p>My name is Abdul Shakoor, and I'm an English teacher currently working as a Subject Specialist at an educational institution. I have a Masters in English, which helps me teach my students effectively. Karachi holds a special place in my heart, as I have many fond memories there. The people of Peshawar, where I currently live, are incredibly warm and friendly, making me feel welcomed. Despite my expertise in English, I'm excited to expand my skills and knowledge by learning web development. It's a new challenge, but I'm eager to take it on and grow professionally.</p>
